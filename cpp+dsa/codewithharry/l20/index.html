        <h1>Object Oriented Programming </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>This is just an approach to make our program.</li>
            <li>Because there are some pitfall of conventional way of programming. So, to eleminate them we use OOPS
            </li>
            <li>OPPs promises some stuff like
                <ul>
                    <li>Your program will be bug free</li>
                    <li>Program will be easily understandable.</li>

            <h2>Why Object-Oriendted Programming?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented programming to C
                    language</li>
                <li>As the size of the program increases readability, maintainability, and bug-free nature of the
                    program decrease.</li>
                <li>This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon functions or procedure (hence the
                    name procedural programming language</li>
                <li>As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem adequately was high</li>
                <li>Also, data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised</li>
                <li>Using classes solves this problem by modeling program as a real-world scenario</li>
            </ul>

                                <li>Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow</li>
                                <li>The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data</li>
                                <li>Functions can either use local or global data</li>
                                <li>Data moves openly from function to function</li>
