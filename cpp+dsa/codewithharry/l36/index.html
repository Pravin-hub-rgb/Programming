                <li>Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs</li>
                <li>In C++ we can resues a class and add additional features</li>
                <li>Reusing classes saves time and money</li>
                <li>Reusing already tested and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging

            <h2>What is Inheritance in C++?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance</li>
                <li>We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it</li>
                <li>The existing class is called a base class</li>
                <li>The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class</li>
                <li>Reusing classes saves time and money</li>
                <li>There are different types of inheritance in C++</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Forms of inheritance </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Multiple Inheritance</li>

                <h3>Single Inheritance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a derived class in inherited iwth only one base class.
                        <li>For example, we have two classes "employee" and "programmer".</li>
                        <li>If the "programmer" class is inherited from the "employee" class which means that the "programmer" class can now implement the functionalities of the "employee" class.</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Hierarchical Inheritance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is type of heritance in which several derived classes are inherited from a single base class.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Multilevel Inheritance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a type of inheritance in which one class is inherited from another derived class.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Hybrid Inheritance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.</li>
                    <li>In hybrid inheritance, a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritances. However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.</li>
