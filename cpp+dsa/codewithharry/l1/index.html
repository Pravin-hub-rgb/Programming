           <h2>What is programming, programming language, and why C++?</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>Programming can be understood as your instructions to the computer(machine) to solve real problems</li>
            <li>A programming language helps us communicate with the computer.</li>
            <li>Analogous to us humans, who need some language, be it English, Hindi, or Bangla, to talk to our people, computers too need a language to converse.
                <ul>
                    <li>Just to name a few, there is C++, C, Python, Java, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Now when we start listing the names of these programming langugaes, the question which instinctively arises is why C++. Despite this being an 80s programming language, it never lost its sheen. 
                <ul>
                    <li>C++ was an added version of C developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.</li>
                    <li>It is believed to be very close to the hardware making it comparatively easy for programmers to give the instructions directly to the system without any intermediatry.</li>
                    <li>Another reason for C++ to be one of the most used languages is it its object-orientedness.</li>
                    <li>C++ is an object-oriented programming language giving it the power to create real-world software systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
           </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Install IDE</b></li>
                <li><b>Install g++</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>g++ is a compiler that helps us convert our source code into a .exe file.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Extension of c++ programming language is .cpp</li>
