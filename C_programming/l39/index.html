                <h3>What are similarity between union and structures</h3>
                <p>
                    Structure and union are user-defined data types used to store data of different types. <br> The members of structure and union can be objects of any type, including other structures and unions or arrays. <br> A union or a structure
                    can be passed by value to functions and returned by value by functions. <br> '.' operator is used for accessing union and structure members.

                <h3>What are difference between union and structures</h3>
                <p>
                    The keyword union is used to define a union and a keyword struct is used to define the structure. <br> Each member within a structure is assigned a unique storage area of location whereas memory allocated is shared by individual members
                    of the union. <br> Individual members can be accessed at a time in structure whereas only one member can be accessed at a time in union. <br> Altering the value of the member will not affect other members of the structure, whereas
                    altering the value of any member will affect other member's values. <br> Several members of a structure can be initialized at once, whereas only one member can be initialized in union
