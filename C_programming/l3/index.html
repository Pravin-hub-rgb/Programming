                        <p>
                            Integrated Development Environment
                            <br>&rarr;Here we can do syntax highlighting & syntax checking
                            <br>&rarr; tells about error in line no.
                            <br>&rarr;IDE stands for Integrated development environment. It is nothing more than an enhanced version of a text editor that helps you write more efficient and nicer code. It helps to differentiate different parts of your
                            codes with different colors and notifying you if you are missing some semicolon or bracket at some place by highlighting that area. A lot of IDEs are available such as DEVC++ or Code Blocks but we are going to use VS Code for
                            this tutorial series.

                        <p>
                            We have to install it
                            <br>&rarr;It is used to run the program of any certain language by converting the code into the language that our computer could understand.
                            <br>&rarr;Without a compiler we can not run our code. Every programming language is required
                            a different compiler for its functioning because the syntax of every language is different from the other. There are a lot of compilers available, but we are going to use MinGW for this course because it will fulfill all of
                            our requirements and also it is recommended by Microsoft itself.
