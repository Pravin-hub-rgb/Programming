        <h1>Why Learn C Programming Language?</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>In todays world if we are learning any programming language then we definately insure that the language
                is stable in last 5 years and also have a good position in user stats</li>
            <li>Within few years C programming is going to celebrate its 50th birthday. In last 50 years C has performed
                very well and also programmers love it by heart.</li>
            <li>C programming popularity has been increasing day by day and it will keep on increasing. It looks like
                the scope of C programming will not end in near future.</li>
            <li>And according to Developer Survey Results 2019 C programming language is one of the top 10 languages
            </li>
            <li>C programming in software market is one of the most popular and demanding skills and if you know C
                programming then your chances to get hire increases because C is fast, popular and easy to use. Yes C is
                easy to use if you know some constructs
                and know how to use those constructs and write a good programs so C is very powerfull.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="wh" id="t2">
            <h1>Why C is so fast?</h1>
            <ul>
                <li> Because in C programmers have many controls, programmer can manage its own memory.</li>
                <li> If programmer plan its logic and algorithm then he can be close to machine learning codes.</li>
                <li> If you will use the same logic in python then it will not work fast.</li>
                <li> So if you need speed then you should use C programming language.</li>
                <li> If you are making a game engine where you want that by pressing a button it do some actions then C
                    is used.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class=" in ">
                <h2>
                    What are the things that are build in C
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Linux operating system, Windows OS, Mac OS</li>
                    <li>MySQL database</li>
                    <li>Ruby and Pearl programming languages</li>
                    <li>First compiler of Java</li>
                    <li>Apache and NGINX (related to web servers [to surf websites])</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Reason? Because C is the lowest level portable language means - that with C we have so much controls
                    that we can reach to CPU instructions
                </p>
                <p>More lowest language than C is <a href=" ">assembly language</a> but in assembly language coding is
                    very difficult</p>
                <p>Some keywords that you will learn later <a href=" ">CPU instructions</a>,&nbsp;<a href=" ">CPU
                        cycles</a></p>
                <p>Some python libraries are written in C, So C is used to support other programming languages so that
                    they run faster.</p>

            </div>
            <p>If you know C programming than C++ will be very easy.</p>
            <p>The one who does competitive programming they also use C or C++</p>
            <div class="in ">
                <p>C programming is used where we need to squeeze our performence more or want more performance out
                    of our programs in less time and with high accuracy.</p>
