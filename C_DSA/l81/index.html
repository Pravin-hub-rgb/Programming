        <h1>LL, RR, RL, LR rotations in AVL Tree</h1>
        <div class="wh">
            <p>
                Before we procedd witht exmaples of the rotations we learned, we should know how a binary search tree
                that is unbalanced can be balanced with a few Rotate Operations.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Rotate Operations</h3>
                <p>
                    We can perform Rotate operations to balance a binary search tree such that the newly formed tree
                    satisfies all the properties of a binary search tree.
                    <br>Following are the two basic Rotate operations.
                <ol>
                    <li>Left Rotate Operations</li>
                    <li>Right Rotate Operations</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <div class="wh">
                    <h3>Left Rotate Operations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this operation, we move our unbalanced node to the left.</li>
                        <li>Consider a binary search tree given below, and the newly formed tree after its left rotation
                            with respect to the root.
                            <br><img src="../images/rot.jpg" alt="">
                        </li>
                        <li>One thing to observe here is that node 11 had to change its parent after the rotation to be
                            able to maintain the balance of the tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <h3>Right Rotate Operations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this operations, we move our unbalanved node to the right.</li>
                        <li>Consider a binary search tree given below, and the newly formed tree after its right
                            rotation with respec to the root.
                            <br><img src="../images/rot2.jpg" alt="">
                        </li>
                        <li>You can see that node 11 had to change its parent after the rotation to be able to maintain
                            the balance of the tree.</li>
                        <li>And rotating a tree to its left, and tahen again to the right, yields the same original tree
                            as you can see from the above two examples.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        We learned the rotation so let's apply it on AVL tree to balance it.
                        <br>We can follow the below-mentioned rules.
                    <ol>
                        <li>For Left-Left insertion &darr;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Right rotate once with repect to the first imbalance node.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>For Right-Right insertion &darr;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Left rotate once with respect to the first imbalance node.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>For Left-Right insertion &darr;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Left rotate once and then Right rotate once.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>For Right-Left insertion &darr;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Right rotate once and then left rotate once</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        We'll now see how a complex tree gets balanced again after an insertion. <br>Consider the binary
                        search AVL tree below:
                        <br><img src="../images/rot3.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The absolute balance factor of each node is written beside, and you can see how balanced the
                            values are.</li>
                        <li>Now suppose we need to insert an element that gets its position to the right of node D.</li>
                        <li>Now the updated tree tooks something like this.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/rot4.jpg" alt="">
                    And the tree got imbalanced. Now, you follow these steps.
                    <ol>
                        <li>First search for the node which got imbalanced first.
                            <ul>
                                <li>start iterating from the node we inserted at and move upwards looking for that first
                                    imbalanced node.</li>
                                <li>Here node A is the one we were searching for.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>What type of insertion occured?
                            <ul>
                                <li>Here, the insertion happened to the left to the left of node A.</li>
                                <li>So, this belongs to the first rule we saw above.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Follow the rule
                            <ul>
                                <li>Right rotate once with respect to the first imbalance node. So, the tree after
                                    rotating to the right becomes
