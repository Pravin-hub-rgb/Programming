            <ul>
                <li>A tree is made up of nodes and edges.</li>
                <li>The topmost node is called the node which points to another node, is the <b>parent</b> of that node
                    and the node which the parent is pointing at is the <b>child</b> of that parent node. And nodes
                    having the same parents are called <b>siblings</b> of each other.</li>
                <li>Nodes having zero children are the <b>leaf nodes/external nodes</b>, and nodes having at least one
                    child are the <b>internal nodes</b></li>
                <li><b>Ancestors</b> of a node are the nodes accessible by traversing upwards along the edges. They are
                    either the parents or the parents of the parents.</li>
                <li><b>Descendansts</b> of node are the nodes accessible by traversing downwards along the edges. They
                    are either the children or the children of the children</li>
                <li><b>Height</b> of a node is the number of edges in between the deepest leaf and that node. And
                    <b>depth</b> of a node is the number of edges between the root and that node.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Additional points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A tree with <b>n</b> nodes have <b>n-1</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a tree, there is one and only edge correspoinding to all the nodes except the root node.
                            The root node has no parent, hence no edge pointing to it. Therefore, a total of n-1 edges.
                        </li>
                        <li>The <b>degree of node</b> in a tree is the number of children of a node.</li>
                        <li>The <b>degree of tree</b> is the ighest degree of a node among all the nodes present in the
                            tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><img src="../images/tree4.jpg" alt=""></li>
                <li>In the above tree, the number of nodes is 9, and hence the number of edges are 8.</li>
                <li>Highest degree of a node is that of the root node, which has 3 children. Hence, the degree of the
                    tree is also 3.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Binary Tree</h1>
            <p>A binary tree is a special type of tree where each node has a degree equal to or less than two which means each node should have at most two children 
                <br><img src="../images/tree5.jpg" alt="">
                <br>Example 1 has nodes A, B, C, D, E with degrees (2, 0, 1, 1, 0) respectively which satisfies the conditions for a binary tree. Similarly, example 2 has nodes A and B, having degrees 1 each, hence a binary tree.
