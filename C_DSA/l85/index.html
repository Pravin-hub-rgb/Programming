            <h2>What is graph traversal?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex (node) in a graph.</li>
                <li>A smaller graph seems relatively easy to traverse. But when it comes to traversing a graph with a
                    huge number of nodes, the process needs to be automated.</li>
                <li>Sequences of steps that are used to traverse a graph are known as graph traversal algorithms. There
                    are two algorithms that are used for traversing a graph
