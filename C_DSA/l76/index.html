                <li>If you know search operation then it's easy</li>
                <li>And as there are no duplicates in a binary search tree. So, if you search the element you are being
                    asked to insert, you would print that the number already exists.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <p>Here is an example binary search tree, and the element we want to insert is 9.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Start from the root node, and check if the element you want to insert is greater than or lesser
                        than.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since 9 is greater than 8</li>
                    <li>move to the right of the root</li>
                    <li>now root is the 10</li>
                    <li>since this time 9 is less then 10</li>
                    <li>move to the left of element 10</li>
                    <li>since there are no elements to its left</li>
                    <li>insert 9 there.</li>

                <p>
                    This was one simple case, but things becomes more complex when you have to insert your element at
                    some internal position and not at the leaf.
                <ul>
                    <li>Before you insert a node, the first thing you would do is to create that node and allocate
                        memory to it in heap using malloc or createNode function.</li>
                    <li>Initialize the node with the data given, and both the righ and the left member of the node
                        should be marked NULL.</li>
                    <li>Another important thing to see here is the pointer you would follow the correct position with.
                    </li>
                    <li>In above example, to be able to insert at that position, the pointer must be at node 10.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../images/insertBST3.jpg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>And then you check wheter going to the left side is good, or the right.</li>
                    <li>Here, you came to the left, but had it been right, we would have updated our pointer <i>ptr</i>
                        further and maintained a second pointer to the previous root.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Creating the insert function</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a void function <i>insert</i> and pass the pointer to the root node, and the data of the
                        node you want to insert as its parameter</li>
                    <li>Use two struct pointers to traverse through the tree.
                        <ul>
                            <li>One of them would be our <i>root</i> which we would traverse through the nodes.</li>
                            <li>Another one would be <i>prev</i> which stores the pointer to the previous root</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Run a while loop that is for until we reach some leaf, and couldn't traverse further.
                        <ul>
                            <li>So, run thant loop until the root becomes NULL</li>
                            <li>Inside that loop
                                <ul>
                                    <li>make the <i>prev</i> = current loop. Since we would definitely move further
                                        because this root is not a NULL.</li>
                                    <li>check, if the root itself is not equal to the node we are trying to insert. That
                                        is,
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Write an if condition to see if there are any duplicates here</li>
                                            <li>If there is return from the function here itself.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>move either to the left of this root or to the right of this root.</li>
                                    <li>Further in the loop, check if the element you want to insert is less than the
                                        current root.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If it is, update the root to the left element of the struct root.</li>
                                            <li>If it isn't, update the root tot the right elment of the struct root.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>And since we have already stored this root in the <i>prev</i> node,
                                                there ins't any issure updating.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>And finally, you will have a <i>prev</i> node as the outcome at the end after
                                        this loop finishes.</li>
                                    <li>Now, the only procefure left now is to link these nodes together, that it the
                                        prev node, the new node and the node next to the prev.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Now before you insert, make sure you create that new struct node.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                In below example, where 4 is the element we wanted to remove and seems quite an easy job. Just search
                for the element and remove it.

                <br>Bul deleting in a binary search tree is no doubt a tough job like if you consider a case where the
                node is not a leaf node or it is a root node.

                <h3>Deleting a non-leaf node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Here we can't just make its parent point to NULL.</li>
                    <li>We have to deal with the children of this node.</li>
                    <li>Let's try to delete 6</li>

                <div class="in">
                    <ul>
                        <li>First search the element 6</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/del.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now the dilemma is, which node will replace the position of node 6.</li>
                        <li>When you delete a node that is not a leaf node, you replace its position with its <b>InOrder
                                predecessor or InOrder successor.</b></li>
                        <li>So, what does that mean?
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you write the InOrder traversal of the above tree.</li>
                                <li>the nodes coming immediately before or after node 6, will be the one replacing it.
                                </li>
                                <li>InOrder traversal = 1→ 3→ 4 →6 →7→ 8→ 10→ 13→ 14</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>So, the InOrdr predecessor and the InOrder successor of node 6 are 4 and 7 respectively.</li>
                        <li>Hence we can substitute node 6 with any of these nodes, and the tree will still be valid binary search tree.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/delBST4.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>So, both are still binary search tree.</li>
                        <li>In the first case, we replaced node 6 with 4, and the right subtree of node 4 is 7, which is still bigger than it.</li>
                        <li>And in the second case, we replaced node 6 with node 7.</li>
                        <li>And the left subtree of node 7 is 4 which is still smaller than the node. Hence,  both cases are win-win case.</li>

                    <h3>Deleting the root node.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you carefully observe, the root node is still another non-leaf node.</li>
                        <li>So, the basics to delete the root node remains the same as deleting non-leaf node.</li>
                        <li>But since the root node holds a big size of subtrees along with, we have put this as a separate case here.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/delBST5.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>So, the first thing you do is write the InOrder traversal of the whole tree, and then replace the position of the root node with its <b>InOrder predecessor or InOrder successor</b></li>
                        <li>The traversal order = 1→ 3→ 4 →6 →7→ <b>8</b>→ 10→ 13→ 14</li>
                        <li>So, the InOrder predecessor and the InOrder successor of the root node 8 are 7 and 10 respectively</li>
                        <li>Hence you can substitute node 8 with any of these nodes</li>
                        <li>But there is a catch here. So, if you substitute the root node here, with its InOrder predecessor 7, the tree will still be a binary search tree,</li>
                        <li>But, when you substitute the root node here, with its InOrder successor 10, there still becomes an empty position where node 10 used to be.</li>
                        <li>So, we still placed the InOrder successor of 10, which was 13 on the position where 10 used to be. And then there are no empty nodes in between. This finalizes our deletion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="../images/delBST6.jpg" alt="">
                    <ul>
                        <li>So, there are few steps:
                            <ol>
                                <li>search the node to be deleted</li>
                                <li>search for the InOrder predecessor and successor of the node</li>
                                <li>keep doing that until the tree has no empty nodes</li>
                                <li>and this case is not limited to the root nodes, rather any nodes falling in between a tree.</li>
                                <li>well, there could be a case where the node was not found in the tree, so, for that, we would reverst the statement that the node could note be found.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
