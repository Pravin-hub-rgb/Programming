                                <li>Trees are useful in representing an organizational hierarchy. <br> Example &darr;

                                <li>Another good example would be our file manager in desktops. <br>There is a C Drive,
                                    it contains folders Windows, Program Files, etc. Which further contain folders. So,
                                    they are hierarchically represented using a tree.</li>

                <h3>1 &rarr; Full or Strict Binary trees:</h3>
                <p>
                    Strict binary tree is having all of its nodes with a degree of 2 or 0. That is each of its nodes
                    either have 2 children or a leaf node.
                    <br>Simple example &darr;
                    <br><img src="../images/bin2.jpg" alt="">
                    <br>Bellow illustrated is a binary which is not a strict or full binary tree because the colored
                    node has a degree of just 1.
                    <br><img src="../images/bin3.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>2 &rarr; Perfect Binary Tree</h3>
                <p>
                    A perfect binary tree has all its internal nodes with degree strictly 2 and has all its leaf nodes
                    on the same level. A perfect binary tree as the name suggests appears exaclty perfect. Few examples
                    below.
                    <br><img src="../images/bin4.jpg" alt="">
                    <br>Every leaf node above in both the examples are on the same level and all the internal nodes have
                    a degree 2. Below illustrated is a binary which is not a perfect binary tree because the colored
                    node is an internal node and has a degree of just 1, although each leaf node is on the same leve.

                <h3>3 &rarr; Complete Binary Tree</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has all its levels completely filled except possibly the last level.</li>
                    <li>And if the last level is not completely filled then the last level's key must be all
                        left-aligned.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../images/bin6.jpg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>In above figure 1, all levels are completely filled, so nothing further needs to be done. It is
                        a complete binary tree</li>
                    <li>In figure 2, all nodes are completely filled except the last level which has just 3 keys. It is
                        nonetheless a complete binary tree as all the keys are left-aligned.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below illustrated are some non-complete binary trees
                    <br><img src="../images/bin7.jpg" alt="">
                    <br>In both the figures, the last level is not complete. And hence we check if all the nodes are
                    algined to the left. But they aren't in both cases. And hence both of them are not complete.

                            <li>Skewed trees having all the child nodes alighned to the left are called <b>left-skewed trees</b></li>
