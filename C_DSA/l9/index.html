                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visiting every element of an array once is known as <b>traversing</b> the array. </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>An array can easily be traversed using a for loop in C language.</li>

                <h3>Insertion</h3>
                <p>
                    An element can be inserted in an array at a specific position. For this operation to succeed, the array must have enough capacity.
                    <br><br>Suppose we want to add an element 10 at index 2 in the below-illustrated array, then the element after index 1 must shifted to their adjacent right to make way for a new element.
                    <img src="../images/array3.jpg" alt=""> When no position is specified, it's best to insert the element at the end to avoid shifting, and this is when we achieve the runtime O(1).
                    <br>And for worst case we have to insert the element in 0 index then the runtime will be O(n).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Deletion</h3>
                <p>
                    An element at a specified position can be deleted, creating a void that needs to be fixed by shifting all the elements to their adjacent left, as illustrated in the figure below.
                    <br><br>We can also bring the last element of the array to fill the void if the relative ordering is not important. <br>
                    <img src="../images/array4.jpg" alt="">
                    <br><br>The best case could be deleting the last element with the runtime of O(1) and the worst case would be deleting the first element with the runtime O(n).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Searching</h3>
                <p>
                    Searching can be done by traversing the array until the element to be searched is found. O(n) There is still a better method called binary search. Binary search method only applicable for sorted arrays. Therefore, for sorted arrays, the time taken to
                    search is much less than an unsorted array. O(logn)

                <h3>Sorting</h3>
                <p>
                    Sorting means arranging an array in an orderly fashion (ascending or descending). We have different algorithms to sort arrays.
