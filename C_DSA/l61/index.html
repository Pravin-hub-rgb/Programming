                A tree usually represents the hierarchy of elements and depicts the relationships between the elements.
                <br><br> Trees are considered as one of the largely used facets of data structures.
                <br>To give you a better idia of how a tree looks like, let me give an example
                <br><img src="../images/tree.JPG" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every circle represents a node.
                </li>
                <li>Every arrow represents the hierarchy.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                <p><b>Terminology used in trees:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Root</b>&rarr; The topmost node of tree. <ul>
                            <li>There is no edge pointing to it</li>
                            <li>But one or more then one edge oiginating from it.</li>
                            <li>Here, A is the root node.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Parent</b>&rarr; Any node which connects to the child.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Node which has an edge pointing to some other node.</li>
                            <li>Here, C is the parent of H.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Child</b>&rarr; Any node which is connected to a parent node. <ul>
                        <li>Node which has an edge pointing to it, from some other node</li>
                        <li>Here, H is the child of C </li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Siblings</b>&rarr; Node belonging to the same parent are called siblings of each other.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes B, C and D are siblings of each other, since they have the same parent node A.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Ancestors</b>&rarr; Node accessible by following up the eges from a child node upwards.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ancestors are also the parents of the parent of.. that node</li>
                        <li>Here, node A, C and H are the ancestors of node I.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Descendants</b>&rarr; Nodes accessible by following up the edges from a parent node downwards.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Descendants are also the child of the child of .... that node.</li>
                        <li>Here, node E, F, G and I are leaf nodes.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Leaf/External node</b>&rarr; Nodes which have no edge originating from it, and have no child attached to it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>These nodes cannot be a parent</li>
                        <li>Here, nodes E, F, G and I are leaf nodes.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Internal node</b>&rarr; Nodes with al least one child. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here, nodes B, D and C are internal nodes.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Depth</b>&rarr; Deapth of a node is the number of edges from root to that node. <ul>
                        <li>Here, the depth of nodes A, C, g and I are 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.

                    </ul></li>
                    <li><b>Height</b>&rarr; Height of a node is the number of edges from that node to the deepest leaf. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here, the height of node A is 3, since the deepest leaf from this node is node I.</li>
                        <li>Similarly, height of node C is 2.</li>
