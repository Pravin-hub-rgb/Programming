            <h2>What is Breadth First Search?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In breadth first search, start with a node (not necessarily the smallest or the largest) and start
                    exploring its connected nodes.</li>
                <li>The same process is repeated with all the connecting nodes until all the nodes are visited.</li>
                <li>We should first learn the concept of BFS spanning tree in order to understand the breadth first
                    search.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Method 1: BFS Spanning tree:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider the graph below
                        <br><img src="../bfss1.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, choose any node, say 0, and try to construct a tree with thise chosen node as its root.
                        <br><img src="../images/bfss2.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, mark dashed or simply remove all the edges which are either sideways or duplicate to turn
                        this graph into a valid tree,
                        <ul>
                            <li>And as you know for a graph to be a tree, it shouldn't have any cycle.</li>
                            <li>So, we remove the edges between nodes 2 and 3, and then between nodes 1 and 2 being
                                sideways.</li>
                            <li>Then also between 2 and 4. You could have rather removed the one between node 3 and 4
                                instead of 2 and 4, but both ways work since these are duplicate to node 4.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The tree we receive after we do these above mentioned steps changes to
                        <br><img src="../images/bfss3.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>This constructed tree above is known as a BFS Spanning Tree.</li>
                    <li>The level order traversal of this BFS spanning tree gives us the breadth first search traversal
                        of the graph we started originally with
                        <ul>
                            <li>Level order traversal &rarr; we simple wirte the nodes in the same level from left to
                                right.</li>
                            <li>So, the level order traversal of the above BFS spanning tree is 0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Method 2: Conventional Breadth First Search Traversal Algorithm</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider the graph below
                        <br><img src="../images/con1.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Considering we could begin with any source node, we'll start with 0 only.</li>
                    <li>Let's define a queue named <b>exploration queue</b> which would hold the nodes we'll be
                        exploring one by one</li>
                    <li>We would maintain another array holding the status of whether a node is already <b>visited</b>
                        or not.</li>
                    <li>Since we are starting with node 0, we would enqueue 0 into our exploration queue and mark it
                        visited
                        <br><img src="../images/con2.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, we'll start visiting all the nodes connected to node 0, and remove node 0 from the
                        exploration queue, enqueuing all the currently visited nodes which were nodes 1, 2 and 3.</li>
                    <li>We are pushing them inside the exploration queue because these might further have some unvisited
                        nodes connected to them. Mark these nodes visited as well.
                        <br><img src="../images/con3.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>After this, we have node 1 at the top in the exploration queue, so we'll take it out and visit
                        all unvisited nodes connected to it. Unforturnately, there aren't any. Therefore, we'll continue
                        exploring further.
                        <br><img src="../images/con4.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, we have node 2. And the only unvisited node connected to node 2 is node 4.</li>
                    <li>So, we'll mark it visited and will also enqueue it in our exploration queue.
                        <br><img src="../images/con5.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Node 3 is the next in line. Since, all nodes 1, 3 and 4 which are the nodes connected to it are
                        already visited, we have nothing to do here while we are on node 3.
                        <br><img src="../images/con6.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, we have node 4 on the top in the exploration queue. Let's get it out and see what nodes
                        are connected and unvisited to it. So, we got nodes 5 and 6. Mark them visited and push them
                        inside the exploration queue.
                        <br><img src="../images/con7.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And now we can explore the other two nodes left in the queue, and since all nodes are already
                        visited, we’ll get nothing in them. And this got our queue emptied and every node traversed in
                        Breadth-First Search manner.
                        <br><img src="../images/con8.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>And the order in which we marked our nodes visited is the Breadth-First Search traversal order.
                        Here, it is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</li>
                    <li> So basically, the visited array maintains whether the node itself is visited or not, and the
                        exploration queue maintains whether the nodes connected to a node are visited or not. This was
                        the difference.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <p>
                    Let's now see how the process we did manually above can be automated in C although we will be using
                    pseudocode for now.
                <ol>
                    <li>We'll take a whole graph and the information about its nodes and eges as the input along with
                        the source node <i>s</i>.</li>
                    <li>We'll mark the node <i>s</i> visited and then create a queue, and enqueue <i>s</i> in it.</li>
                    <li>We'll then initiate a while loop which run until the queue is not empty. At each iteration, we
                        will take out the first element out of the queue, and visit all the vertices already not visited
                        and connected to it while enqueueing every new node we visit in the queue.</li>
                    <li>Below is the pseudocode,
                        <br><img src="../images/pse.png" alt="">
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Few important points
                        <ol>
                            <li>We can start with any vertex.</li>
                            <li>There can be multiple breadth first search results for a given graph</li>
                            <li>The order of visiting vertices can be anything.</li>
                            <li>The order of visiting vertices can be anything.</li>
