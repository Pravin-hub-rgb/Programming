                <h3>Quick brief revision of the characteristics of AVL trees.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        AVL trees are height-balanced binary search trees.
                    </li>
                    <li>It gives an upper bound of O(logn) to all the operations possible in a Binary search tree </li>
                    <li>Balance factor, BF = Height of Right Subtree - Height of Left Subtree, and for a binary search
                        tree to be an AVL tree, |BF| should be less than or equal to 1 for all of its nodes.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>An example for an AVL tree is:
                    <br><img src="../images/avl5.jpg" alt="">

                <h3>Why rotation is done in AVL tree</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In an AVL tree, rotations are performed to avoid the unbalancing of a node caused by insertion.
                        Now,
                        suppose we have a small AVL tree having just these two node.
                        <br><img src="../images/avl6.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>The balance factor of both the nodes are good, but as soon as we insert a new node having data
                        4,
                        our updated tree becomes unbalanced to the left. The absolute balance factor of node 7 becomes
                        greater than 1.
                        <br><img src="../images/avl7.jpg" alt="">
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the method you will follow to make this tree an AVL again is called <b>rotation</b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <p>
                    Now rotation can be of different types, one of them being the <b>LL rotation</b>
                </p>
                <div class="wh">
                    <h1>LL Rotation</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name LL, just because we inserted the new element to the left subtree of the root.</li>
                        <li>In this rotation technique, you just simply rotate your tree one time in the clockwise
                            direction as shown below
                            <br><img src="../images/avl8.jpg" alt="">
                        </li>
                        <li>So, our tree got balanced again, with a perfect balanced factor at each of its node. Next,
                            we have the RR rotation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>RR Rotation</h3>
                <ul>
<li>Now, supporse we have a small AVL tree having just these two nodes.
    <br><img src="../images/avl9.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>The balance factor of both the nodes are good, but as soon as we insert  a new node having data 11, our updated tree becomes unbalanced to the right.</li>
<li>The absolute balance factor of node 7 becomes greater than 1.
    <br><img src="../images/avl10.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>So, the method you will follow now to make this tree an AVL again is called the RR rotation.</li>
<li>The name RR, just because we inserted the new element to the right subtree of the root.</li>
<li>In this rotation technique, you just simply rotate your tree one time in anti-clockwise direction as shown below
    <br><img src="../images/avl11.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>So, our tree got balanced again, with a perfect balanced factor at each of its nodes.</li>

                <h3>LR Rotation</h3>

<li>Now, supporse we have a small AVL tree having, just these two nodes
    <br><img src="../images/avl12.jpg" alt="">

<li>The balance factor of both the nodes are good, but as soon as we insert a new node having data 5, our updated tree becomes unbalanced to the left.</li>
<li>The absolute balanced factor of node 7 becomes greater than 1.
    <br><img src="../images/avl13.jpg" alt="">
</li>
<li>So, the method used to make this again a AVL tree will be LR rotation</li>
<li>The name LR, just because we inserted the new element to the right to the left subtree of the root.</li>
<li>In this rotation technique, there is a subtree complexity, which says, first rotate the left subtree in the anticlockwise direction, and then the whole tree in the clockwise direction.</li>
<li>Follow the two steps illustrated below
    <br>Step 1:<img src="../images/avl14.jpg" alt="">
    <br>Step 2:<img src="../images/avl15.jpg" alt="">

<li>Method used is RL rotation.</li>
<li>The name RL, just because we inserted the new element to the left to the right subtree of the root.</li>
<li>We follow the same technique we used above, which says, first rotate the right subtree in the clockwise the direction, and then the whole tree in the anticlockwise direction.</li>
