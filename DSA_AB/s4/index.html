           <h2>Introduction to Data Structure</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>Data is a integral part of our application or programs.
                <ul>
                    <li>Program is a set of instruction which performs operations on data to get some results.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We should know about these terms:
                <ol>
                    <li>Data structure</li>
                    <li>Database</li>
                    <li>Data warehouse</li>
                    <li>Big Data</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <div class="in">
            <h3>Data structure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It can be defined as arrangement of collection of data items so that they can be utilized efficiently and operations on that data can be done efficiently.</li>
                <li>The arrangement and operation on data take place inside the main memory and during the execution of a program.</li>
                <li>During the execution of the program, how the program will manage data inside the main memory and perform the operations that is data structure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How the program utilizes data and how they put the data in inside the main memory? &darr; &darr; &darr;</p>

            <h3>Database</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When data is larger in size or commercial data (used in businesses like banks, retail stores, etc.) they will have lot of data and they will have some organized data in the form of database table or relational data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data warehouse</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We have talked about commercial data that is data used in businesses, so they will have huge amount of data and it will grow day by day.</li>
                <li>The large size data may not be used daily like many year old data.</li>
                <li>Commercial data can be categorized into two parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Operational data &rarr; used daily.</li>
                        <li>Legacy data (old/historical data) &rarr; data kept in storage and if required we can fetch the data and use it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>So, that historical data is kept on array of disk as it is historical data of any commercial firm, this storage is <b>data warehouse.</b></li>
                <li>For commerical firm this data warehouse are helpful for analyzing the business.</li>
                <li>The algorithm written for analyzing the warehouse data are known as <b>data mining algorithms.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Big data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The data avialable in internet like data about things, people and places, by analyzing this data decisions are taken that is for management, governance, businesses analysis.</li>
                <li>Study related to storing and utilizing that large size data is <b>big data.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <li>Short summary:
                <ol>
                    <li>Data structure: arrangement of data in main memory.</li>
                    <li>Database: arrangement of data in disk.</li>
                    <li>Data warehouse: array of disk.</li>
                    <li>Big data: large data used in internet.</li>

            <h2>Static vs Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
            <p>Here we will discuss the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>About main memory</li>
                    <li>How a program use memory</li>

                <h3>How heap memory is utilized by a program?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heap means piling things up.</li>
                    <li>Heap is used in two cases:
                        <ol>
                            <li>If the things are properly organized like a tower.</li>
                            <li>If the things are not organized.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Heap term can be used for both organized things and not organized things.</li>
                    <li>In main memory, heap is an unorganized memory.</li>
                    <li>Stack memory is organized.</li>
                    <li>Heap memory should be treated as a resource, means when required should be utilized and when we don't require we should release the memory.</li>
                    <li>Program cannot directly access heap memory so they use pointer to access heap memory.</li>
                </ul>
